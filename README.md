# Reproducible Graduate Theses in GIScience

As part of an [iniciative](https://osf.io/j97zp/) to explore teaching strategies to increase the exposure to and understanding of reproducible research in the area of GIScience, we conducted an intervention with students enrolled in two GIS-related master’s programmes. The `self-assessment-experiment.Rmd` R notebook analyses participants’ responses to two questionnaires (pre-test and post-test) on their previous knowledge of reproducible research concepts and practices, and the self-assessment exercise on the reproducibility level of the master’s theses.
